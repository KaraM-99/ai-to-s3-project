# 🤖 AI to AWS S3 – Motivational Message Upload

This is my first cloud + AI practice project as part of my journey into tech and cloud engineering.  
It’s a simple but meaningful script that creates a motivational message for women in tech and uploads it to an AWS S3 bucket using the AWS CLI.

## 💡 Project Goal
To practice:
- Writing Python code in a Jupyter notebook
- Saving text files
- Uploading to Amazon S3 using the AWS CLI
- Connecting AI + cloud workflows

## 📝 The Message

> "To every woman stepping into tech: You belong here. Your curiosity, creativity, and courage are your superpowers.  
> Even when the path feels uncertain, keep showing up — because the future is waiting to be built by voices like yours.  
> Stay bold. Stay brilliant. You’ve got this."

## 🧪 How to Run This Notebook

1. Make sure you have:
   - AWS CLI installed
   - AWS configured using `aws configure`
   - Your own S3 bucket created (replace the name if different)

2. Open the `ai-to-s3.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

3. Run each cell step-by-step:
   - It saves the motivational message as a `.txt` file
   - Then uploads it to your bucket

## ☁️ Bucket Info

- **Bucket name:** `karabo-ai-projects`  
- **Region:** `us-east-1` (N. Virginia)
